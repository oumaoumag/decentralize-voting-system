## 📝 Assignment: Create a Basic Todo List in Solidity

In this assignment, you'll create a simple Todo List smart contract to demonstrate key Solidity concepts such as enums, structs, mappings, arrays, and events.

---

## ✅ Instructions

### 1. Create a Todo Status Enum

Define an enum to represent the status of a todo:

```solidity
Pending
InProgress
Completed
````

---

### 2. Create a Todo Struct

Create a struct named `Todo` with the following fields:

```solidity
id (uint)
content (string)
status (use the enum from step 1)
```

---

### 3. Use a Mapping and Array

* Use a mapping to store todos by ID:

```solidity
mapping(uint => Todo)
```

* Use an array to track all todo IDs:

```solidity
uint[] public todoIds
```

---

### 4. Implement Basic Functions

* `addTodo(string memory _content)` – Adds a new todo
* `updateStatus(uint _id, Status _status)` – Updates a todo’s status
* `getTodo(uint _id)` – Returns a specific todo item

---

### 5. Add One Simple Event

Emit an event when a new todo is added:

```solidity
event TodoAdded(uint id, string content);
```
